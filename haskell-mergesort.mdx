# Implementation of Merge Sort in Haskell

Merge Sort is a popular sorting algorithm known for its efficiency and stability. In Haskell, it can be elegantly implemented using the divide-and-conquer strategy. Let's explore how Merge Sort works and implement it in Haskell.

## Understanding Merge Sort

Merge Sort follows the divide-and-conquer paradigm by dividing the input list into smaller sublists until they consist of a single element. It then merges these smaller sorted sublists to produce a fully sorted list. The key operation in Merge Sort is the merging of two sorted lists into a single sorted list.

## Implementation in Haskell

Here's an implementation of Merge Sort in Haskell:

```haskell
-- Merge function to merge two sorted lists
merge :: Ord a => [a] -> [a] -> [a]
merge [] ys = ys
merge xs [] = xs
merge (x:xs) (y:ys)
    | x <= y    = x : merge xs (y:ys)
    | otherwise = y : merge (x:xs) ys

-- Merge Sort function
mergeSort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
mergeSort [] = []
mergeSort [x] = [x]
mergeSort xs =
    let (left, right) = splitAt (length xs `div` 2) xs
    in merge (mergeSort left) (mergeSort right)
```

The merge function merges two sorted lists, while mergeSort recursively divides the input list into smaller parts and merges them together using the merge function.

## Usage and Testing

You can use the mergeSort function as follows:

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
    let unsortedList = [4, 2, 5, 1, 3]
    putStrLn "Unsorted List:"
    print unsortedList

    let sortedList = mergeSort unsortedList
    putStrLn "Sorted List:"
    print sortedList
```

## Conclusion

Merge Sort is a robust sorting algorithm known for its stable and efficient nature. In Haskell, its implementation follows a simple and elegant recursive approach, utilizing list manipulation functions to merge and sort smaller sublists. The resulting implementation showcases the functional elegance and expressiveness of Haskell in dealing with algorithms like Merge Sort.
